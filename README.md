# connect_four_ruby

This project is a part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s Curriculum, specifically the [Ruby course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby).

It's built using TDD, and this is the first time I am building a project using this approach. It has been a great opportunity to learn rspec as well.

## game play

This game requires two players. Each player attempts to be the first to play four tokens in a row, be it vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. The first player to do so wins.
